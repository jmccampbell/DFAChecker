	<p class="middleText">A determinist finite automaton (here referred
	to as a DFA), is a type of finite state machine that takes an input of a string
	of characters and rejects or accepts that string. What makes DFAs "deterministic"
	is that each string has one unique way of passing through the DFA. A DFA is shown
	as a number of circles, each representing a state, and arrows, representing
	arcs between states. A given DFA has a finite alphabet, and each state in that
	DFA must have an arc associated with each character in that alphabet, in order to
	guarantee that there will be one unique path through the DFA for each valid string.</p>

		<p><i>This DFA accepts all strings with an alphabet including a's and b's 
		that start with <span>a</span>, and rejects all such strings that start with <span>b</span>.</i></p>
	</figure>
	<p class="middleText">When a string passes through a DFA, it begins in the DFAs start
	state (the start state of DFAs shown here is always labeled "0". The string then passes to the next state based on its first character and
	the arcs leading from the first state. The string follows the arc that corresponds
	to its first character to a new state. The process is then repeated at that new state
	with the second character in the string, and continues until there are no more
	characters. Once the DFA has examined every character, it can make a determination
	about whether or not to accept the string. This determination is made based on the
	state the string occupies after its final character. If a strings ends in an accepting
	state, indicated here with a double circle, it is accepted. Otherwise, it is rejected.
	See a more complicated example below. </p>

		<p><i>This DFA accepts all strings with an even number of both <span>1's</span> and <span>0's</span>.
		For example, the string <span>1001</span> moves from state <span>0</span> to state <span>1</span>, from state <span>1</span> to state
		<span>3</span>, from state <span>3</span> to state <span>1</span>, and finally from state <span>1</span> to state <span>0</span>, where it is accepted.</i></p>

	<p class="middleText">As it turns out, every regular language, that is, every language that
	can be described by the strict rules of a regular expression, can be represented as a DFA 
	that accepts every string in the language and rejects every string not in the language.
